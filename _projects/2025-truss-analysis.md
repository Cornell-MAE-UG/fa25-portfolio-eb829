As part of a class project I designed the actiator and the bars to have fixed pins as supports. This produces a reacrion force in the x component for both supports to counteract the forces caused by the bar (actuator). I picked this activator as it fits the size limitation, if I choose the bar to be of equal dimention to make an equilateral triangle (strongest shape). Appart from this, the actuator I shose has the max force limitation under the length 0.577.
