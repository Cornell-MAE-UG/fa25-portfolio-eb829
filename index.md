## About Me

Hello! My name is Esmeralda Bernal.
I’m a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University’s School of Engineering, also pursuing a minor in business at the Dyson School. I’m passionate about combining technical problem-solving with creativity and collaboration. My experience spans computer-aided design (CAD), quantitative analysis, and leading team-based projects. At Cornell, I apply these skills as a teaching assistant for BEAM and as a campus manager for Thrive Scholars, where I mentor first-generation students and help organize workshops that promote academic success and community building. I enjoy working in dynamic, team-oriented environments and love learning through new challenges. Looking ahead, I hope to blend my engineering background and business mindset to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact in the field.
